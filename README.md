# PowerBI_Project_2_Procurement_Card_Transactions

INTRODUCTION
The request was submitted to analyze the Card Payment in the Procurement Department in 2001 and 2014 years.
I am interested in details about this topic, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 

ANALYSIS
To analyze and visualize this data, DAX (Data Analysis Expression) and PowerBI were utilized respectively.
The calculation of the quantity of and the sum of the transactions were performed for each cardholder, each responsible department and each merchant.
The ranking of the transactions was also demonstrated for cardholders and each department and merchant. 
The calculation for year over year and month over month transactions were also performed for each entity.
An in-depth analysis was also done to demonstrate the sum of the total transactions of by QTD and YTD for every entity.
